title: Determining generic point configurations from unlabeled path or loop lengths
year: 2017
---

In this paper we study the problem of reconstructing a configuration of points in 
$$d\ge 2$$ dimensions from an unlabeled sequence of Euclidean lengths arising under an ensemble of paths or loops. 
We provide a sufficient trilateration-based condition for the reconstruction to be uniquely determined and a numerical 
procedure for performing this reconstruction. 

Our results are obtained by completely characterizing the linear automrophisms of the 
"unsquared measurement variety" of $$n$$ points in $$d$$ dimensions for all $$n$$ and $$d$$. 
The special case of $$n=4$$ and $$d=2$$ corresponds to the well known Regge symmetries 
of the tetrahedron.
