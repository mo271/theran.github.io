title: Rigid components of random graphs
year: 2009
conferenceprocname: CCCG’09
---

We study the emergence of rigid components in an Erdős-Rényi random graph
$$\mathbb{G}(n,p)$$, using the parameterization $$p = c/n$$ for a fixed constant $$c >
0$$. We show that for all $$c > 0$$, almost surely all rigid components have size 2, 3 or
$$\Omega(n)$$; for $$c > 4$$, we show that almost surely there is a rigid component of size
at least $$n/10$$.
