A hypergraph $$G$$ with $$n$$ vertices and $$m$$ hyperedges with $$d$$ endpoints each is
$$(k,\ell)$$-sparse if for all sub-hypergraphs $$G'$$ on $$n'$$ vertices and $$m'$$
edges, $$m'\le kn'-\ell$$. For integers $$k$$ and $$l$$ satisfying $$0\le l\le dk-1$$,
this is known to be a linearly representable matroidal family. Motivated by problems in
rigidity theory, we give a new linear representation theorem for the $$(k,l)$$-sparse
hypergraphs that is natural; i.e., the representing matrix captures the vertex-edge
incidence structure of the underlying hypergraph $$G$$.
