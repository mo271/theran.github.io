title: Analytic analysis of auxetic metamaterials through analogy with rigid link systems
---

Recent progress in advanced additive manufacturing techniques has stimulated the growth 
of the field of mechanical metamaterials. One area particular interest in this subject 
is the creation of auxetic material properties through elastic instability. This paper focuses 
on a novel methodology in the analysis of auxetic metamaterials through analogy with rigid 
link lattice systems. Our analytic methodology gives extremely good agreement with finite 
element simulations for both the onset of elastic instability and post-buckling behaviour 
including Poisson's ratio. The insight into the relationships between mechanisms within lattices 
and their mechanical behaviour has the potential to guide the rational design of lattice 
based metamaterials.
