title: Characterizing sparse graphs by map decompositions
year: 2007

A map is a graph that admits an orientation of its edges so that each vertex has out-degree exactly 1. We characterize graphs which admit a decomposition into $$k$$ edge-disjoint maps after: (1) the addition of any $$\ell$$ edges; (2) the addition of some $$\ell$$ edges. These graphs are identified with classes of sparse graphs; the results are also given in matroidal terms.
